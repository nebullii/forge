# Demo Checklist

## 1 Hour Before

- [ ] App is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Test the live URL (not localhost!)
- [ ] Clear any test/debug data
- [ ] Seed with demo-worthy sample data
- [ ] Test on phone/different browser

## 30 Minutes Before

- [ ] Practice the 2-minute pitch
- [ ] Practice the happy path 3 times
- [ ] Know what to skip if running long
- [ ] Have backup screenshots ready (in case it crashes)
- [ ] Charge your laptop

## 5 Minutes Before

- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs/apps
- [ ] Turn off notifications
- [ ] Open the app to the starting point
- [ ] Have the pitch deck ready (if using one)
- [ ] Take a breath

## During Demo

- [ ] Start with the problem (30 sec)
- [ ] Show the solution working (60 sec)
- [ ] Explain one interesting technical choice (30 sec)
- [ ] End with impact/next steps

## If Something Breaks

1. Don't panic - it happens to everyone
2. Use backup screenshots
3. Explain what it would have shown
4. Focus on what you learned building it

## Common Demo Mistakes

- Showing code instead of the app
- Explaining every feature (pick 2-3)
- Apologizing for bugs (own it or skip it)
- Going over time (practice to stay under)
- Forgetting to show the actual thing working
